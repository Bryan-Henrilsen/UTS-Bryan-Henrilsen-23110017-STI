            <h1>Mobile Legends</h1>
            <p>Since 2017, I've been exploring the world of Mobile Legends. Throughout this journey with the game, I've
                found immense enjoyment and engaging challenges. It's not just entertainment for me; it's also an avenue
                to build strong relationships with friends. We often gather to play together, working as a team to
                improve our rankings. Each match teaches us something new and provides unforgettable moments of
                excitement. For us, Mobile Legends isn't just a game; it's a social experience that strengthens our
                friendships.</p>

            <h1>Genshin Impact</h1>
            <p>Since September 5, 2021, I've immersed myself in the world of Genshin Impact. Initially, I felt extremely
                confused about how to play, the game's features, and everything else within it. This confusion led to
                frustration, and I was on the verge of uninstalling Genshin Impact from my device. However, everything
                changed when I met a fellow online player who also enjoyed Genshin Impact. Patiently, they taught me
                every aspect of the game, from the basics to more advanced strategies. Thanks to their help and
                encouragement, I navigated through those challenging times and have continued to enjoy the adventures in
                the world of Genshin Impact to this day.</p>
