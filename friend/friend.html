            <p>My first friend is Wincent Vladimir. We've known each other since we were in the 2nd grade of junior high school. As we progressed through the grades, we met two more friends, and together, we shared joyful moments, exchanged jokes, laughter, and cherished memories. Our friendship has grown stronger over the years, built on trust, understanding, and mutual respect. Through thick and thin, we've stood by each other's side, supporting and encouraging one another. Wincent Vladimir and our two other friends have become an integral part of my life, and I'm grateful for the bond we share.</p>

            <p>My second friend is Brandon Stardino. We crossed paths when I was in the 3rd grade of junior high school. Initially, Brandon and I were merely acquaintances, engaged in casual conversations while my friend, Wincent Vladimir, and I were together. However, as time went on, we found ourselves connecting on a deeper level, discovering common interests and shared experiences. Before we knew it, Brandon became an inseparable part of our circle of friends. Our bond grew stronger with each passing day, marked by laughter, shared adventures, and unwavering support. Brandon's friendship has enriched my life in countless ways, and I'm grateful for the unique connection we share.</p>

            <p>My final friend is Steven Salim, affectionately known as Ameng. He's somewhat introverted by nature, but the more time I spent with him, the more he opened up, gradually evolving into a close friend. Alongside my other two friends, Wincent Vladimir and Brandon Stardino, we share jokes, support each other, and stand together through thick and thin. Our friendship is built on mutual respect and understanding, and it continues to thrive as we navigate life's ups and downs together.</p>
